# Variable Font Demo
A simple iOS demo of variable fonts. Pan vertically and horizontally to maniuplate the two axes weight and italics or use system volume controls to manipulate weight. This project was built to work with the Ortho Remote for smooth scaling but listens for any system volume changes.
